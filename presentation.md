# Smile for me!

![I'm going to make you smile!][title_image]

One of the best thing about giving a gift it to see the recipient's smile on their face!

Thanks to this wrap, giving a digital gift over the web doesn't have to be a smile-less experience.

### The way it works is quite simple:

- Click the *'Wrap my gift'* and pick the digital item you wish to wrap.
- Choose a method of delivery, it can be by email or through Facebook, or you can manually send the link to the wrap by any other mean you wish.
- Once the receiver opens the link, he or she will be asked to upload a photo of themselves smiling.
- A clever piece of software will then check if there is a smile on the photo uploaded, if no smile was given the receiver will have to try harder :)
- Once the smile has been received, we will send a you a notification so you can look at the picture and the receiver will be able to unwrap their gift.
